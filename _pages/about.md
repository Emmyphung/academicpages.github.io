I'm an MS in Data Science student at New York University (NYU), specializing in **machine learning and deep learning for natural language processing**. Before coming to NYU, I obtained a BS in Economics from Trinity College (Hartford, CT) and had a year working in **data analytics consulting** for startups from various industries such as ads tech, media and entertainment, financial services, etc.

My passion for data science stems from my interest in Behavioral Economics, my undergraduate concentration, which studies human and business behaviors from an economic perspective. For example, Behavioral Economics explains what drives behind our systematically irrational decisions, such as why we are crazy about free items even when they have no consumption value to us. Detecting such insights requires data, knowledge, and skills, which leads me to study data science. My goal is to attain mastery over data science to **translate human insights into data-driven and human-focused technology solutions**.

Skills
======
During my master's, I dig deeper into Probability & Statistics and Linear Algebra, the foundation of Machine Learning, and acquire solid training in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Big Data. I've become proficient in data querying with SQL, data mining and predictive modelling in Python, big data processing in Hadoop and Spark, model training with graphics processing units (GPU), etc. Examples of projects I've worked on are **building a book recommender system (using ALS), predicting psychiatric readmission from clinical notes (using BERT, LSTM), predicting the infection rate and risk level of COVID-19 in regions with missing reports (using Random Forest, Ridge Regresion, Gradient Boosting).**
