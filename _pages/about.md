I'm an MS in Data Science student at New York University, specializing in machine learning and deep learning for natural language processing. 

My passion for data science stems from my interest in Behavioral Economics (BE), my undergraduate major, which studies human and business behaviors from an economic perspective. For example, BE explains what drives behind our systematically irrational decisions, such as why we are crazy about free items even when they have no consumption value to us. Detecting such insights requires data, knowledge, and skills, which leads me to study data science. My goal is to attain mastery over data science to translate human insights into data-intensive and human-focused technology solutions.
