I'm an MS in Data Science student at New York University (NYU), specializing in **machine learning and deep learning for natural language processing**. Before coming to NYU, I obtained a BS in Economics from Trinity College (Hartford, CT) and had a year working in **data analytics consulting** for startups from various industries such as ads tech, media and entertainment, financial services, etc.

My passion for data science stems from my interest in Behavioral Economics, my undergraduate concentration, which studies human and business behaviors from an economic perspective. For example, Behavioral Economics explains what drives behind our systematically irrational decisions, such as why we are crazy about free items even when they have no consumption value to us. Detecting such insights requires data, knowledge, and skills, which leads me to study data science. My goal is to attain mastery over data science to **translate human insights into data-driven and human-focused technology solutions**.

Skills
======
During my master's, I dig deep into Probability & Statistics and Linear Algebra, the foundation of Machine Learning, and acquire solid training in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Big Data. I've become proficient in data querying with SQL, data mining and predictive modelling in Python, big data processing in Hadoop and Spark, model training with graphics processing units (GPU), etc. Examples of projects I've worked on are **building a book recommender system (with ALS), predicting psychiatric readmission from clinical notes (with BERT, LSTM), predicting the infection rate and risk level of COVID-19 in regions with missing reports (with Random Forest, Ridge Regresion, Gradient Boosting).** 

Interests
======
**Community Project**
Pivoting into data science from a non-tech background, I have had to pick up a lot on my own, through reading blog posts, attending online courses, and learning from online Data Science/AI community. This motivates me to share my learning journey to inspire and help other young learners, especially those from my home country, Vietnam. I founded and am currently managing **Data Science in Brief (DSinbrief)**, an online community of 2,500 Data Science practitioners, learners, and enthusiasts in Vietnam. 

**Visual Arts**
I love visual arts. To me, it is a natural form of communication that can speak more than words. And it is of endless fun. I've worked with sculpture, collage, multi-media, photography, fashion, book illustration, painting and graphic design, all of which have brought me so much joy. I've always sought opportunities to incorporate my visual thinking into my work, such designing infographics for companies I've worked for as a side project, helping startups editing their business pitch deck, and visualizing data to better communicate my findings.
